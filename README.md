#  AI-Powered Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer user queries instantly. The chatbot uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and web scraping to provide information based on content from a website and a JSON file. It’s built using Python, Flask, and JavaScript, making it a seamless and interactive web-based chatbot.

## Features

- **Instant Responses**: The chatbot is designed to respond instantly to user queries, giving a seamless conversational experience.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes NLP for understanding and generating responses.
- **Web Content Extraction**: Scrapes content from a specified website to provide relevant answers.
- **JSON File Integration**: Allows for additional information extraction using a JSON data source.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and clean UI with a chat window for easy interaction.
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Answers both basic greetings and complex queries with detailed responses.
- **Error Handling**: Provides friendly feedback if the query cannot be processed.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) - Web framework
  - [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - Web scraping
  - [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) - Embedding and NLP
  - [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) - Natural Language Toolkit
- **Frontend**:
  - [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - Markup language
  - [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Styling
  - [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Frontend logic

## Usage

- **Start a Conversation**: Type your message in the input field and hit the "send" button.
- **Receive Responses**: The bot will instantly respond with an appropriate answer.
- **Greet the Bot**: Try simple greetings like "Hello", "Hi", or "Hey".
- **Ask for Information**: The bot can answer questions based on the website content and JSON data.


## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user types a query into the chat window.
2. **Backend Processing**:
   - Flask server receives the request.
   - Natural language processing is used to interpret the query.
   - If relevant, data is fetched from the web content or a JSON file.
   - A response is generated using sentence embeddings and similarity scoring.
3. **Bot Response**: The response is sent back to the frontend and displayed in the chat window.
